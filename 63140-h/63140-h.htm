<br />HISTORY OF THE STEAMBOAT.</h1>
<p>In the spring of 1828, my law office was in the
Athen&aelig;um building, so called, afterwards
destroyed by fire. My business was scant,
for I had but recently been admitted to the bar.
I was ruminating, no doubt, upon my prospects,
when the door was opened, and a handsome,
elderly man, of distinguished presence, entered
and asked me, in rich unctuous tones, and with
a strong Irish accent, if my name was Latrobe,
and if I recollected him. His face was familiar,
and so was his voice; but I could not place him.
Seeing that I hesitated, he said, &ldquo;and it would
be strange if you did, for you were but a bit of
a child when you last saw me in your father&rsquo;s
house. I am John Devereux Delacy,&rdquo; and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
rolled out his sounding name as though he was
proud of it. I recollected him then. Fourteen
or fifteen years back it had been his fancy to pet
me as a child. It was this that had impressed
him on my memory. &ldquo;Ah, you know me now,&rdquo;
he said: &ldquo;you remember when I used to be so
much with Fulton and Roosevelt and Chancellor
Livingston and Dr. Mitchell, at the Navy Yard
house.&rdquo; This was the name given to my father&rsquo;s
residence in Washington, not far from the Navy
Yard. After recalling well remembered incidents
and indulging in general remarks for a while, Mr.
Delacy took a survey of my scantily furnished
office, and said, &ldquo;not overwhelmed with business,
my young friend: so much the better for me: you
will have the more time to attend to something
I want you to undertake. If you succeed, it will
be the making of both our fortunes. I want suit
brought against every steamboat owner in the
United States; and you must begin with old Billy
McDonald, here in Baltimore. See this;&rdquo; and,
suiting the action to the word, my visitor drew
from his breast pocket the original parchment
letters patent, now before me, signed by James
Madison, President, James Monroe, Secretary
of State, and Richard Rush, Attorney General,
granting to Nicholas J. Roosevelt the exclusive
right to his &lsquo;new and useful improvement in propelling
boats by steam.&rsquo; Dated December 1st,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
1814. The patent had still some months to run.
The specification contained the following description
of the improvement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a boat or vessel of any form, but of sufficient
capacity to contain the machinery, I place a steam
engine of a power proportioned to the resistance
to be overcome in propelling a boat or vessel a
given distance in a given time. This steam engine
is supplied by a boiler of the usual form, or made
cylindric, one or more at pleasure, so as to be
of sufficient capacity to feed the engine. I next
place two wheels over the sides, on the axles of
which I put fliers, dispense with them, or otherwise,
contrive them at pleasure, either to regulate
motion, or to give additional velocity; or, they
may be connected with the valve shaft and steam
engine by wheels, so as to give any number of
revolutions that may be desired. The arms of
the water wheels I would make of wood, to which
I attach floats or paddles of cast iron or thick
boiler plate sheet iron, though they may be made
of wood. These floats I make move up and down
on the arms by means of screws and holes, so as
to make them deeper or shallower in the water,
in taking a hold on the water, agreeably to the
depth of the water the boat may draw, or the
lading there may be on board, or agreeably to
other circumstances. The supporters of the outer
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
ends of the water wheel shaft to be made of iron
with braces, though they may be made of wood,
if required.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lr"><span class="sc">Nicholas J. Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p class="t0">Witnesses:</p>
<p class="t"><span class="sc">Jeremiah Ballard</span>,</p>
<p class="t"><span class="sc">John Dev&rsquo;x Delacy</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Delacy watched me closely as I read the letters
patent; and, I remember, placed his gloved finger
on his own name at the bottom. I had not been
carried away by his promise of a case. He was
remarkably well preserved; but his habiliments
approached what might have been called seediness;
although his air and carriage would have
borne up against even longer used apparel. It
was easy to be seen that a contingent fee was all
that could be expected: but the parchment, the
accuracy of the description, its perfect correspondence
with the steamboats in use, and its date,
made the case look better than I had at first
thought it would.</p>
<p>Taking the letters patent from me, Mr. Delacy
placed in my hands a carefully prepared assignment
from Roosevelt to William Griffith, an eminent
lawyer of New Jersey, conveying them in
trust for the benefit of Roosevelt, for one-third
interest, of Delacy, for one-third, and of Griffith
and Aaron Ogden, of a well known and distinguished
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
family, for the remaining third. The
assignment gave Griffith the power to sell rights
and sue infringers; and excepted from its operation
the Shrewsbury and Jersey Stage Company
and Ogden, who were already licensees of Roosevelt,
the latter running a boat between Elizabethtown
and New York.</p>
<p>Nor was this all. Delacy, who evidently was
pleased with the impression he saw he was making,
next handed me an opinion on a case stated,
given by Mr. Wirt, in 1826, of which the following
is an extract:</p>
<h3 id="c1">CASE.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the year 1809, Robert Smith, Esquire, then
being Secretary of State, an application was made
to him by the late Robert Fulton, Esq., for a
patent for the using of vertical wheels with steam
engines or other power to propel boats through
the water; but though he filed such his application,
&amp;c., he neither subscribed nor swore thereto
in the manner prescribed, or required, by law;
for the name, Robert Fulton, is in the handwriting
of another man.</p>
<p>In 1814, (under view of the circumstances,) a
patent was granted to Nicholas J. Roosevelt, for
the using vertical wheels with steam engines, or
other acting power, to propel boats, &amp;c., through
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
water, the patent or papers issued to Fulton being
considered void, and but as so much blank paper.</p>
<p>Public notice was given of the patent having
been granted to Roosevelt, and Fulton never urged
his claim, but from that moment abandoned it;
and Roosevelt&rsquo;s patent, though well and publicly
known to exist, and to be in existence for twelve
years, has been neither impeached nor impugned;
neither does any other person lay claim to the
invention of the application of vertical wheels.</p>
<p>It is asked, if, under the within stated circumstances,
the patent to Roosevelt is not valid; and
at this distance of time from being issued, is not
now unimpeachable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other questions were asked in connection with
the assignment. Mr. Wirt&rsquo;s answer to the above
is alone important however at this time. It is
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Baltimore</span>, <i>July 11th, 1826</i>.</p>
<p>On the above statement I am of opinion, that
the patent to Roosevelt is valid. It is still subject
to impeachment, however, on the ground that he
was not the first discoverer of the improvement
which he has patented. The distance of time since
the date of the patent is sufficient to bar a proceeding
to set it aside by <i>scire facias</i> under the
third section of the Act of 1793; but any defendant,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
against whom an action may be brought under
the patent, may impeach it at any distance of time,
under the sixth section of the Act of 1793.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Satisfied from this showing that Mr. Delacy&rsquo;s
case was not a bad one, I agreed to undertake
it, and wrote to Mr. Roosevelt, in the State of
New York, upon the subject. He corroborated
all that I had heard, sent me copies of important
correspondence, and referred me to Richard S.
Coxe, Esq., of Washington, who was the executor
of Mr. Griffith, the assignee for the original papers.
Mr. Griffith had then been for many years dead.</p>
<p>Among my clients, at this time, was the late
Mr. John S. Stiles, who, hearing what had taken
place with Delacy, agreed, in consideration of participating
in my fee, to visit Washington, call on
Mr. Coxe, obtain the Griffith papers, and afterward
go to Clermont, the residence of the late
Chancellor Livingston, who, I learned from Mr.
Roosevelt, was connected with the investigation
I was about to make.</p>
<p>On the return of Mr. Stiles to Baltimore, and
after an examination of papers he had obtained,
the case looked so strong, that I called on Mr.
Wirt, reminded him of his opinion, shewed him
my documents, and asked him if he would come
into the case on a contingent fee. I called also
on Mr. Taney. Both gentlemen thought the prospect
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of success was fair; and both agreed to participate
in the trial, which was to take place in the
Circuit Court of the United States, in Baltimore.
It was thought best, on consultation, to begin the
litigation by suing the company owning the steamboats
running from Baltimore to Frenchtown, at
the head of which was the late General William
McDonald; and I addressed myself, at once, to
as thorough a preparation as I was capable of
making, prior to issuing a writ. Difficulties now
presented themselves which I had not appreciated
when Mr. Delacy called on me, or while gathering
the documentary evidence. I am reminded of the
first that occurred by Mr. Roosevelt&rsquo;s reply to my
letter already mentioned. It was necessary that
we should have a meeting; but to bring this about
required an hundred dollars, which neither of us
had to spare. Then, commissions were necessary
to collect the testimony of parties at a distance.
In a word, it was apparent that more means were
needed than I, a young lawyer, just beginning
the world, could command; and Mr. Stiles had
spent all <i>he</i> could afford in his visits to Washington
and Clermont. I was in trouble, too, about
Delacy. He had procured, on credit, from Patterson,
the then fashionable tailor in South street,
a complete outfit; and not having the money to
pay for it, Patterson, who was unwilling to wait
until our success at law made my client&rsquo;s fortune,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
put him in jail, in spite of his sounding name
and lofty bearing. I had to become security for
him, and ultimately to pay the debt. By this
time, I had found out that he had an aptitude
for this sort of thing; and that it would be for
my own advantage, and the credit of the great
case, to get him out of town as soon as possible.
Always buoyant in his feelings, gushing in his
manner, and intending to be honest, he was one
of those men who are always in trouble. As
already intimated, therefore, I was not as hopeful
at the end of some months as I had been; and,
when Mr. Taney asked me, one day, how my
preparation was getting on, I told him, candidly,
all my troubles, present and prospective. His
advice was kind and prompt. The case he still
thought was a fair one, and if it went on he would
go into it with earnest zeal; but, he advised me
not to hamper myself in the commencement of
my professional career. One thing was certain.
I would have against me every steamboat owner
in the United States. Now-a-days, combinations
often carry on these great cases. It was not so
then; and, after discussing the matter with Mr.
Stiles, I tied up my papers, and abandoning the
idea of suing General McDonald, placed them in
the pigeon-hole, where, with a single exception,
they have remained undisturbed for upwards of
forty years, and now see the light, only that this
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
Lost Chapter may be written. The exception was
this. In 1855 or 1856, I lent the package to Dr.
Hamel, a Russian <i>savant</i>, who was about preparing
a history of steam navigation, and who visited
America to obtain information on this and other
subjects. The papers remained in his hands for
some months. They were returned when he was
on the eve of departure for Europe. He has been
dead for many years; and I am not aware that
he made any use of what he got from me. It is
probable, therefore, that what I am about to tell
will be told for the first time, now. It seems
proper that it should not be wholly lost, and
hence I tell it.</p>
<p>To us, of to-day, it appears strange that the first
suggestion of steam, as a motive power for the
propulsion of vessels was not accompanied by a
plan for using vertical wheels over the sides to
which to apply it. And yet, this was very far
from being the case. Fitch, in 1783, propelled a
boat upon the Delaware by a steam mechanism
that moved paddles, as an Indian works the paddle
in a canoe. Rumsey had a vertical pump, operated
by steam, in the middle of his boat, that drew
in water at the stem and expelled it at the stern,
through an horizontal trunk in the bottom. Dr.
Franklin&rsquo;s plan was to make a current of steam
propel the vessel as it issued from the stern.
Then steam was applied to oars, and for a season
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
a boat was rowed by steam between Philadelphia
and Bordentown. Dr. Kensey built a steam engine
that was to operate upon oars, paddles and flutter
wheels. Fulton himself, as stated by his biographer,
Colden, after subjecting Rumsey&rsquo;s mode to
the test of calculation, &ldquo;thought of paddles and
duck&rsquo;s feet, abandoning which, he took up the
idea of using endless chains with resisting boards
upon them as propellers. His calculations,&rdquo; still
using Colden&rsquo;s language, &ldquo;giving him a favorable
opinion of the mode; at least, he was persuaded
it was greatly preferable to any other method
that had been previously tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above were notions, mere notions, all of
them&mdash;all of them were utter failures; and the
enumeration of them, now, excites our astonishment
that any one of them should have been tried.
Long before the day of Fulton, long before the
earliest period to which Fulton, at any time, ever
attempted to carry back the plan of steam navigation,
it was, as I have shewn, entertained and
practically experimented on, here in America, by
Fitch, Rumsey, Kensey and others, all of whom
failed to succeed. What made it a success at
last? <i>The use of vertical wheels over the sides of
the vessel.</i> Why had it not succeeded previously?
<i>Because vertical wheels were not combined with steam
power</i> in the production of the desired result&mdash;a
successful steamboat, as now understood. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
merit lies with him, therefore, who first suggested
the combination that produced success,&mdash;describing
it in such a practical shape that the task of invention
was completed, leaving nothing to be done
but the mechanical execution. Was this the merit
of Robert Fulton? Unquestionably it was not;
and the object of this writing is to demonstrate
the fact.</p>
<p>I have before me the original &ldquo;petition of
Nicholas J. Roosevelt to the Honorable the Governor,
the Councils and the Representatives, of
the State of New Jersey, in Legislative assembly
convened,&rdquo;&mdash;dated January 13th, 1815, in which
he &ldquo;asserts (I quote his words) with the modest
and manly firmness of honesty that he is the true
and original inventor and discoverer of steamboats
with vertical wheels now in use.&rdquo; And he prays
from the Legislature, &ldquo;as the constitutional guardians
of the rights of their fellow-citizens and of
the interests of the State,&rdquo; such privileges, as on
examination and hearing he may be thought entitled
to. At this time, there were vague notions
of the powers of the States over their navigable
waters, which the decision of the Supreme Court,
in connection with the steamboat controversy,
dissipated at a later day.</p>
<p>Belonging to an old New York family, whose
worth had been illustrated then, as it has been
since, by the honorable positions that its members
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
have held in that great State, Mr. Roosevelt was
a gentleman of character and education, of an
active enterprising temper, and addicted all his
life to matters connected with civil engineering
and mechanics. Appreciated by all who knew
him as a person of unblemished honor, his word
was independent of his oath; but, attached to the
petition just referred to is an affidavit, not without
interest, of which the following is an extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In or about the year 1781 or 1782, this deponent
resided with a certain Joseph Oosterhaudt,
about four miles above Esopus on the North, or
Hudson river, in the State of New York. That
he did at that time make very many actual experiments,
as well upon mill machinery as upon
the motion and buoyancy of bodies in and through
water; and did then and there make, rig and put
in operation, on a small brook near the house of
the aforesaid Oosterhaudt, a small wooden boat
or model of a boat with vertical wheels over the
sides, each wheel having four arms or paddles,
or floats, made of pieces of shingle attached to
the periphery of the wheels whereby to take a
purchase on the water; and that these wheels
being acted upon by hickory and whalebone
springs propelled the model of the boat through
the water by the agency of a tight cord passed
between the wheels and being re-acted on by the
springs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Soon after the evacuation of the city by the
British, Mr. Roosevelt returned to New York;
and following the bent of his inclinations, we
find him, some years afterward, becoming interested
in the Schuyler Copper mines in New
Jersey, on the Passaic, then called Second river.
Here he found some parts of an old atmospheric
engine, which he used in completing a perfect
machine of that description; and meeting with
an engineer from the establishment of Bolton
&amp; Watt, whom he employed to make improvements,
he built engines for various parties, and
constructed for the water works in Philadelphia,
the ponderous machines, which, for many years,
supplied that city with water, by pumping from
the Schuylkill into the distributing reservoir at
Centre Square. During all this time, the subject
of steam navigation seems never to have been
lost sight of. He wanted to substitute for the
hickory and whalebone of his Esopus experiment
the mighty agent with whose multitudinous uses
the world was then beginning to be familiar.</p>
<p>Among other persons who had heard of Mr.
Roosevelt&rsquo;s views in this direction, was the late
Robert R. Livingston, better known as Chancellor
Livingston, who, on the 8th of December, 1797,
wrote to him (I quote from the original letter now
before me) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stevens mentioned to me your desire to
apply the steam machine to a boat. Every attempt
of this kind having failed, I have constructed a
boat on perfectly new principles which, both in
the model and on a large scale has exceeded my
expectations. I was about writing to England
for a steam machine, but hearing of your wish,
I was willing to treat with you on terms which
I believe you will find advantageous for the use
of my invention.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chancellor was an inventor, but unlike
most inventors was a man of large wealth; and
the result of the correspondence, thus commenced,
all of which is before me, was an agreement
between the Chancellor, Roosevelt, and John Stevens
of Hoboken, to build a boat on joint account,
for which the engines were to be constructed at
Second river by Roosevelt, while the propelling
agency employed was to be on the plan of the
Chancellor.</p>
<p>I have not been able to make out, from the
very voluminous correspondence, the precise character
of the Chancellor&rsquo;s contrivance; but I infer
that it consisted of wheels with vertical axes, submerged
at the stern, that forced a stream of water
outward from between them, and so propelled the
vessel. The inventor&rsquo;s own idea of it must have
been vague in the first instance; for there is
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
scarcely a letter to Roosevelt from the time the
work was commenced, until it was abandoned,
that does not suggest changes and alterations.
Steam appears to have been applied to the
machinery about the middle of the year 1798,
unsuccessfully; and the Chancellor, charging the
failure to want of power in the engine, proposes
to throw the cost of it upon the builder. This
is of course resisted. Further improvements in
the propellers are made. The engine is then
alleged to be <i>too</i> powerful: and so matters go on,
until the 21st of October, 1798, when Roosevelt
writes to the Chancellor, giving him an account
of a trial trip, on which the speed attained was
equivalent to about three miles in still water;
though, with wind and tide, the Spanish Minister,
who was on board and highly elated, estimated
the actual speed at double that amount.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile however, on the 6th of September,
1798, Roosevelt wrote to the Chancellor
an important letter in this connection, in which,
after referring to a change in the plan, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would recommend that we throw two wheels
of wood over the sides, fastened to the axes of
the flys (fly wheels) with eight arms or paddles;
that part which enters the water of sheet iron to
shift according to the power they require either
deeper in the water, or otherwise, and that we
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
navigate the vessel with these until we can procure
an engine of the proper size, which, I think,
ought not to be less than 24 inch cylinder.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No better description of a side wheel steamboat
has ever been given than is contained in this letter
of the 6th of September, 1798, the original draft
of which, with all its interlineations, is now before
me; <i>and this is the first practical suggestion of the
combination which made steam navigation a commercial
success</i>, that there is a record of in America;
and this also, when, as late as 1802, four years
later, Fulton, as we are informed by his biographer,
had become assured, that endless chains and
floats were alone to be relied on!</p>
<p>Receiving no reply to the suggestion, thus made,
Roosevelt writes to the Chancellor on the 16th of
September, 1798, saying: &ldquo;I hope to hear your
opinion of throwing wheels over the sides;&rdquo; when
the Chancellor answers: &ldquo;I say nothing on the
subject of wheels over the sides, as I am perfectly
convinced from a variety of experiments of the
superiority of those we have adopted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, on the 21st October, in the letter giving
an account of the trial trip with the Spanish Minister
on board, Roosevelt says, &ldquo;he would wish the
Chancellor&rsquo;s wheels to be tried, contrasted with
paddles on Mr. Stevens&rsquo; plan, or with wheels over
the sides, so as to ascertain the difference in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
application of the power.&rdquo; To which the Chancellor
answers on the 28th October, 1798, referring
to the Stevens&rsquo; paddles, &ldquo;they are too inconvenient
and liable to accidents to be used&mdash;<span class="smaller">AND, AS FOR
VERTICAL WHEELS, THEY ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roosevelt was at this time so strongly impressed
with the plan that the Chancellor thus peremptorily
put aside, that in a letter of the 21st to the
same John Stevens already mentioned, who, as we
have seen, was one of the partners in the adventure,
he says, &ldquo;I am firmly of opinion that a vessel
may be propelled at the rate of <i>eight</i> miles an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not even the praise of the Spanish Minister
seems to have been sufficient to vitalize the
Chancellor&rsquo;s boat; and we are led to suppose
that it was recognized by all as a failure; for
Stevens, who seems to have had more influence
than Roosevelt, persuaded the Chancellor to adapt
the engine to his contrivance of a set of paddles
in the stern, pushing the boat forward as they
were made by a crank motion to rise and fall.
A rough sketch of this contrivance in a letter from
Stevens, dated July 15th, 1799, is before me. The
experiment so racked the Chancellor&rsquo;s boat as to
make it unfit for use altogether. We wonder
now that such things could have been thought
of even.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>In Mr. Stevens&rsquo; letter there is a passage that
indicates the reliance that was placed on Roosevelt
by this, the most practical of his associates, and
shews him to have been the party on whose skill
the others depended. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, I would wish to determine
on our plan for placing the paddles in the stern
of the boat and provide immediately to put it in
execution. You and Stoudinger (a young man
brought up by Roosevelt, and who subsequently
became Fulton&rsquo;s right hand man, and one of the
first practical engineers in America,) and Smallman
(another of Roosevelt&rsquo;s employees) must lay
your heads together on this subject; and, as soon
as you have fixed upon the plan you conceive will
be most eligible, I wish you would take a ride
down and communicate it to me; and, at the same
time, I can give you the result of my cogitations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Stevens&rsquo; paddles, until they shook the boat
to pieces, were far more successful than any one
of the Chancellor&rsquo;s inventions; and I remember,
distinctly, seeing a boat propelled by paddles in
the harbor of New York, as I crossed the Hudson
on my way to West Point, in the fall of the year
1818. The paddles I refer to, however, were on
the sides, and not at the stern, and were literally
paddles, being square floats attached to upright
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
shafts, which a crank motion caused to rise and
fall.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to understand why the Chancellor
told Roosevelt that his vertical wheels
were not to be thought of, and why Stevens,
confessedly a man of ability and mechanical ingenuity,
preferred his own suggestion. They doubtless
believed that the percussion of the floats of
the vertical wheel as they strike and then enter
the water, and before they exert their greatest
power; which is when they are at right angles
with the surface, was objectionable and would be
fatal to their usefulness. They feared also, most
probably, the further loss of power consequent
upon the lifting of the water as the floats emerged
from it; and, wedded to their own schemes, they
refused to subject the matter to the test of experiment.
The paddles of Stevens, and the floats
on the endless chains, to which Fulton gave the
preference, entered the water perpendicularly, or
nearly so, and were free from what was regarded,
it is to be supposed, as the objection to Roosevelt&rsquo;s
vertical wheels over the sides. That both Stevens
and Fulton were wrong, and that Roosevelt was
right, time has conclusively established.</p>
<p>Unwilling to abandon the idea of steam navigation,
even after so complete a failure, the
Chancellor devised still another plan, which was
executed under Roosevelt&rsquo;s direction at the works
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
on the Passaic, of the details of which I have no
account. In this Roosevelt had no interest. It
proved a failure. From all that I can gather,
from the documents in my possession, the efforts
here described were made in 1798, 1799 and 1800,
almost uninterruptedly, and were controlled by the
Chancellor, who was, evidently, the moneyed man
of the concern, and whose dictum, as we have
said, was regarded as conclusive by his associates.
So promising did the matter seem after Roosevelt
had commenced the engine for the boat, that, in
March, 1798, the Legislature of New York, granted
the Chancellor, &ldquo;the exclusive right of navigating
all boats that might be propelled by steam on all
the waters within the territory, or jurisdiction, of
the State for the term of twenty years, provided
he should, within a twelvemonth, build such a
boat, the mean of whose progress should not be
less than four miles an hour.&rdquo; The month of
March, 1799, elapsed, however, without the condition
of the grant having been complied with.
At a later date, a similar grant was made to
Livingston and Fulton.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the year 1800, Mr. Jefferson
appointed the Chancellor minister to France, where
he remained until 1804, having in the meanwhile
negotiated the treaty which ceded Louisiana to the
United States, and where he made the acquaintance
of Robert Fulton. In 1804, the Chancellor
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
made the tour of Europe, and returned the following
year to the United States.</p>
<p>In Colden&rsquo;s Life of Fulton, there is an account,
in the Chancellor&rsquo;s own words, of the commencement
of his acquaintance with Fulton. I quote:
&ldquo;Robert R. Livingston, Esquire, when minister
in France, met with Mr. Fulton, and they formed
that friendship and connection with each other to
which a similarity of pursuits generally gives birth.
He communicated to Mr. Fulton the importance
of steamboats to their own country; informed him
of what had been attempted in America, and of his
resolution to resume the pursuit on his return, and
advised him to turn his attention to the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have already seen that Mr. Fulton&rsquo;s plan,
after making calculations as to the efficiency of
paddles and ducks&rsquo; feet, was to use endless chains
with resisting boards upon them as propellors.
With these he made a course of experiments on
a little rivulet that runs through the village of
Plombi&eacute;res, in France, in 1802; and &ldquo;addressed
several letters to Mr. Livingston and Mr. Barlow,
giving them a minute account of his experiments
and assurances of the certainty of success which
they afforded him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the Chancellor had informed Fulton of
what had been attempted in America, is admitted
by Colden; and this, too, prior doubtless, to the
experiments at Plombi&eacute;res. That Roosevelt&rsquo;s pertinacity
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
in regard to wheels over the sides was
communicated with other information is not to
be doubted; that the Chancellor should have told
him, as he told Roosevelt, in the letter of October
28th, 1798, &ldquo;that they were not to be thought of,&rdquo;
it is most reasonable to suppose; and that Fulton
agreed with the Chancellor is proved by the &ldquo;assurance
of certain success&rdquo; which he entertained,
of endless chains and floats, or resisting boards.</p>
<p>Between the spring of 1802 and the fall of that
year, Mr. Fulton changed his mind; for he and
Livingston were building a boat, propelled by
Roosevelt&rsquo;s vertical wheels, in January, 1803.
The Chancellor, by this time, had become convinced
that vertical wheels were things &ldquo;to be
thought of.&rdquo; That it was Roosevelt&rsquo;s plan that
was adopted after all their own plans had failed&mdash;the
plan derived, with the details of its execution,
from Roosevelt himself,&mdash;does not seem to admit
of any reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Biography is too often eulogy. The name of
Fulton is irrevocably, and justly, the representative
name in connection with steam navigation
throughout all lands. For a while, and in the
memory of the writer, the name of Livingston
was connected with it in men&rsquo;s mouths. But
Livingston&rsquo;s connection with the subject is fast
being forgotten. Fulton&rsquo;s never will be forgotten,
not because he was the inventor of the steamboat
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
however, not because he first suggested the combination
that made success certain; but because,
in his hands, it became a commercial success.
He was the first who demonstrated its practical
utility, when, in 1807, he made the first voyage
in the Clermont from New York to Albany and
back. Still he was indebted to others, in the first
instance, for the elements of his success.</p>
<p>I have said that biography is too often eulogy.
The biographer becomes jealous of the reputation
of his hero. Colden was not exempt from the
weakness common to his class; and instead of
giving to Roosevelt the credit of having first put
the idea of vertical wheels over the sides into a
practical shape, by his detailed description of their
mechanism, he says that the want of success of a
French inventor, who had horizontal screws on
either side of a boat, &ldquo;it is probable,&rdquo; induced
Mr. Fulton again to resort to the wheels, which,
in the original paper that he communicated to
Lord Stanhope, in 1793, he proposed to use as
propellors. Even had this been so, without any
question having arisen as to the facts, Roosevelt&rsquo;s
model of a boat at Esopus, with its hickory and
whalebone springs, would have been ten years
ahead of the Frenchman.</p>
<p>But there are some matters connected with the
letter to Lord Stanhope, which are not without
interest in this connection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>We have seen that Roosevelt, in January, 1815,
applied to the Legislature of New Jersey, for protection
as an inventor of the vertical wheels over
the sides, for which he had obtained letters patent
from the United States in the preceding month
of December, 1814, being the original document
shewn to me by Delacy. Somewhere about this
time, Mr. Fulton appeared as a witness before the
Legislature in connection with this same subject
of steam navigation; and Colden&rsquo;s life contains a
letter from Mr. Emmet, the celebrated lawyer, in
which he states, that, in order to shew Mr. Fulton&rsquo;s
prior claim to invention, in the application of
&ldquo;water wheels to steamboats,&rdquo; he examined him
to prove a copy of the letter in question. Nothing
was said, it would seem, of its being a copy, when
this was first presented: but Governor Ogden
noticed that the letter was written on <i>American
paper</i>; and, subsequently, Mr. Fulton explained
that the first copy having been considerably worn
out and obscured, he had copied it over again and
attached it to the old drawings. This was made the
subject of uncomfortable criticism by the opposite
counsel; and Mr. Emmet, in his letter, expresses
great indignation at what he states was a malicious
attempt to injure the honor of the dead, and
regrets that he omitted to notice, in his reply,
the insinuations which Mr., afterwards Judge,
Hopkinson permitted himself to make. The occurrence
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
was unquestionably an unfortunate one,
whatever the real facts may have been; and respect
for the memory of Mr. Fulton leads me to hope
that Mr. Emmet was correct in his version of the
transaction. His letter, however, is important in
another aspect: it shews that the merit of the
invention, at the time, was considered to be the
application of vertical wheels over the sides, and
that this was claimed for Fulton on the strength
of the letter to Lord Stanhope and the accompanying
drawings of 1793, notwithstanding the
endless chains and floats already referred to as
illustrating the convictions of 1793.</p>
<p>I have never seen the drawings or read the
letter of Mr. Fulton; but it is difficult for me to
believe that he had invented in 1793, what was
unquestionably the solution of the difficulty, and
yet, in 1802, have dwelt in his letters to Livingston
and Barlow upon his assurances of the certainty
of success with endless chains and resisting
boards. It is with no want of charity, that it is
suggested, that Mr. Colden, in writing a biography,
overlooked the possibility of its logic being
criticized when compared with its facts.</p>
<p>There is some light, however, to be obtained
from Lord Stanhope&rsquo;s reply to Mr. Fulton&rsquo;s letter.
It is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p class="jr1">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Holdsworthy Devon</span>, <i>October 7th, 1793</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sir</span>: I have received yours of the 30th September,
in which you <i>propose to communicate to me</i>
the principles of an invention which you say you
have discovered respecting the moving of ships by
the means of steam. It is a subject on which I
have made important discoveries. I shall be glad
to receive the communication which <i>you intend</i>, as
I have made the principles of mechanics my particular
study, &amp;c.&rdquo; (There are no words italicised
in the original.<span class="hst"> L.</span>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, it is only necessary to read this letter
to be satisfied, that the one to which it is a reply,
and it is not suggested that Mr. Fulton ever wrote
another, could not have described the combination
which made the steamboat the thing that it now
is: or that it could have been accompanied by
drawings shewing the plan finally adopted,&mdash;the
Roosevelt plan, going back as far as 1782, and
described in practical detail in the letter of 21st
October, 1798.</p>
<p>It is true that Mr. Fulton obtained letters patent
of the United States for his steamboat in 1809&mdash;in
reference to which Mr. Colden says, as though
to corroborate Fulton&rsquo;s claim as inventor,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They (the Chancellor and Mr. Fulton) entered
into a contract, by which it was, among other
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
things, agreed that a patent should be taken out
in the United States in Mr. Fulton&rsquo;s name, which
Mr. Livingston well knew could not be done
without Mr. Fulton <i>taking an oath that the improvement
was solely his</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a patent was in fact taken out, in those
days when patents were had for the asking, and
when none of that examination, which now protects
the public, was required by law.</p>
<p>We have already seen, in the case stated for
Mr. Wirt&rsquo;s opinion, the allegation that Fulton
neither subscribed nor swore to the specification;
and that the name Robert Fulton was in the
handwriting of another man. Unless this had
been the fact, it would hardly have been alleged
in a paper, prepared for the opinion of eminent
counsel. But I have before me an original letter
dated Trenton, January, 1815, addressed to Mr.
Roosevelt by Delacy, in which the latter gives
an account of the proceedings before the Legislature,
and in which is this sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fulton has the effrontery to avow his having
got Fletcher to sign his name and makes light of
it, as if he was entitled to violate the laws, as
well as private rights, at pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true, this is the letter of a partizan in a
struggle before the Legislature. Still, the matter
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
of fact would not be misstated in a private correspondence,
where there was no conceivable motive
to mislead.</p>
<p>The committee of the Legislature finally reported,
and very wisely, that it was inexpedient
to make any special provision in connection with
the matter in controversy before that body.</p>
<p>It was in March, 1815, on the heel of the Legislative
proceedings, that the deed of trust to Mr.
William Griffith was made, and the fact of his
accepting the trust, and that Aaron Ogden of
New Jersey, was a party to the transaction, shews
that the cause of Roosevelt as the inventor of
vertical wheels over the sides under the patent
of 1814, was deemed good as against the patent
granted to Fulton four or five years previously.
Had the letter to Lord Stanhope or the reply
thereto, been regarded by the outside world, or
by those interested in the subject, as sufficient to
establish Fulton&rsquo;s prior right to the invention of
vertical wheels over the sides of steamboats, counsel
of the standing of Mr. Griffith would not have
become mixed up in the business, licenses to use
Roosevelt&rsquo;s patent would not have been granted,
nor would I have made the acquaintance of John
Devereux Delacy; for Roosevelt&rsquo;s pretensions would
have been nipped in the bud.</p>
<p>My tale is nearly ended. The object has been
to shew that the merit of the practical suggestion
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
of the employment of vertical wheels over the
sides of steamboats was due to one who has been
lost sight of in this connection, and wholly ignored
in the biography of Fulton, who availing himself
of the suggestion of another, in all its details,
made it a great commercial success, and in so
doing built upon it a lasting fame. That the
papers I have referred to, now collated for the
first time, shew this to be the fact, I think there
can be no question.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to state something in
regard to the subsequent career of Roosevelt.
He was once asked why, with the secret of success
in his possession, he allowed it to slumber.
Why did not <i>he</i> anticipate the Clermont in the
first five years of the present century. I give
the answer in his own words from a manuscript
before me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>First</i>: At the time Chancellor Livingston&rsquo;s
horizontal wheel experiment failed, I was under
a contract with the corporation for supplying the
city of Philadelphia with water, by means of two
steam engines; and, besides, I was under a contract
with the United States to erect rolling works
and supply government with copper, rolled and
drawn, for six 74 gun ships, that were then to be
built. The engines for the supplying of Philadelphia
with water I completed, though with heavy
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
loss. The rolling works I also brought into operation
upon a very extensive scale, and a considerable
quantity of copper was delivered. But the
encouragement from government by which I had
been led into this heavy expense was cut off by
a change of men in the administration. The 74s
were laid aside, and no appropriations were made,
and embarrassment to me was the natural consequence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This embarrassment, in the then condition of
the law, was imprisonment for debts contracted
in getting ready to fulfil his contract. In truth,
he was a broken man. In the meanwhile, on
the return of Livingston and Fulton to America,
the workmen that Roosevelt had brought from
Germany and made what they were, entered
into Fulton&rsquo;s service, and to their skill was he
indebted for the mechanical success of his earlier
boats. In 1807, Roosevelt was introduced to
him; and in a letter from the Chancellor, now
before me, references to old times are pleasantly
made; and, a year or two afterwards, we find
Roosevelt associated with Fulton in the introduction
of steamboats on the Western waters. Here,
he built the New Orleans, the pioneer boat that
descended the river in 1811&mdash;the year of the
comet and the earthquake. The voyage of the
New Orleans is, in itself, a romance; but time
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
does not permit it to be told at present.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
With all his merit, Fulton was not an easy man to
get along with; and Roosevelt had his faults of
temper too, no doubt; and after the successful
voyage of the New Orleans, the two men parted,
and Roosevelt disappeared from public life, and
was lost in the quiet of the domestic circle of a
numerous and happy family. He died at a very
advanced age, not many years ago, forgotten by
the world as he was forgotten by the biographer of
Fulton. He appears again before me, as I write,
as I remember to have seen him in my childhood,
and in after years&mdash;a finished gentleman,
energetic and sanguine, warm and generous in
his temper, a devoted husband and father, and
now made the hero of a lost chapter in the
history of the steamboat.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Proposes Vertical Wheels with the Size of Cylinder and presses for Money Arrangements.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Second River</span>, <i>Sept. 6th, 1798</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dr Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have your two letters of the 31st and 1st inst. before me. Since writing
you the 27th, I made an experiment in order to ascertain as nearly as I
could the power of the engine, and put on your wheels. This was done by
laying the vessel on shore stern foremost so as to leave the wheels entirely
out of the water. The Engine was then put to work at the rate of from
40 to 45 strokes and wheels turned from 160 to 180 revolutions per minute.
When the water first entered them it was thrown out with great violence;
but before it got any considerable depth in them the motion of the engine
was impeded and in a short time entirely stopped. By this experiment I
was fully convinced that the wheels would require a power far greater
than this engine possesses and that any attempts to proceed with the power
we have and the present wheels would be fruitless. I was also farther
convinced (by getting men whose strength was ascertained to turn the
wheels by hand before the operation of the engine) tho&rsquo; she has her full
power and indeed considerably more than as first mentioned, I expected
we would have. Now, Sir, to proceed with the experiment you recommended
of closing the openings with doors will be doing nothing more
than what we have already done by the last trial. <span class="sc">I would therefore
recommend that we throw two wheels of wood over the sides
fastened to the axes of the flys with 8 arms or paddles, that
part which enters the water of sheet iron to shift according to
the power they require either deeper in the water or otherwise
and that we navigate the vessel with those until we can
procure an Engine of proper size which I think ought not to be
less than 24 inches cylinder.</span> The Barometer to ascertain the exact
power of the engine has not as you observe been left to depend entirely on
Mr. Van Ness, although I looked upon him as your Representative according
to the tenor of your own letter; but Mr. Mark and Mr. Speyer have
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
both been on the search for one and have not yet succeeded. The copper
pipe for it is made and we will I believe be obliged to wait for the glass
until we can get it from the glass house above Albany. I have requested
Mr. Speyer, who has gone up to the Oneida country, to call on Mr. Dezang
for that purpose. If you know of any to be had in New York please to
inform me and I will immediately get it.</p>
<p>As to your charge of my want of candor and my possessing too much
distrust, those Sir are charges which have never before been laid to me and
which I feel perfectly free from and I will recommend to the Chancellor
to meet me in future upon equally candid and fair ground. I can assure
him he shall never have reason to complain of me on that score again.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
We have as you observe put our hands to the oars and ought not to look
back until we reach port. This I am for, Sir, with all my heart, and firmly
believe that with this determination we have nothing to fear, as I think,
<i>with the wheels I have recommended</i>, that the State patent may be secured.
We will then have time to prepare for your wheels, and if they should not
have the effect you promise us, we can then adopt such other plans as we
may together think best. No bad consequences need be apprehended from
what I communicated out of your letter to Smallman and Stoudinger as
they are as anxious for the success of the business and your good opinion
as I am. As to altering any of the wheels in the way you propose I cannot
approve, as the alteration will be attended with considerable expense,
and as I believe any alteration we can make with our present small Engine
will be inadequate to driving the wheels to any advantage. In this the
Chancellor will agree with me when he considers that when the Engine
making 30 strokes per minute the horizontal wheels make 120 revolutions
by which 3/4 is taken from the power to afford this.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that Mrs. Livingston may soon recover from her accident
so that you may not be detained long from thoroughly investigating
everything appertaining to our present concern.</p>

<p class="lc">I am, dear Sir, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p class="lr">N. J. ROOSEVELT.</p>
</div>
<p>N. B. I have not, upon overlooking what I have above written, been so
particular in my objections to your proposed alterations as may be agreeable
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
and will ask for a little of your patience. See how the alteration
of the wheels on the connecting rod by being smaller will operate. They
will most certainly shorten the stroke of the engine. This therefore cannot
take place unless we alter the wheels round which they move accordingly,
which may be done. At the same time in doing it we shall be obliged to
lengthen the spindle of the horizontal wheels and disturb the wooden work
the whole of which will be attended with considerable expense and require
a second alteration when we come to operate with power equal to what
those wheels will require, and indeed, why should we go to any expense in
alterations which can do us no service; as I clearly saw from actual experiment
that about 1400 pounds will be necessary to be applied directly to the
wheels independent of friction, which is equal to an engine of 24 inches
Cylinder. An Engine of this size I find has 5424 pounds power independent
of the friction of the machine and I think power enough for the air
pumps (perhaps something more.) This I cannot however ascertain until I
get a barometer and try our present engine, which I believe perfect. I was
about trying the power by weights but found difficulties which I have not
yet been able to get over, as her power is equal both ways, and to bring the
weight only to the connecting rod would tear everything to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I acknowledge receipt of yours of the 3d Inst. By this time you have
doubtless recd. mine of the 6th Inst. which gave you all the information
on the subject of the boat I was then capable of doing; since which I have
thought of trying another experiment upon <i>the present plan</i> and concluded
to morrow to set about it. It will take us three days with two hands
which will cost very trifling and enable us to calculate with more certainty
what power will be required <i>for your wheels</i>. The plan is this. Sun and
planet wheels we will take off and form a double crank with the coupling
links, which at one end will be fastened to the shaft of the fly wheels by
taking out the brasses and drilling holes for pins to enter. This change
will give us only half the motion of your wheels we first contemplated and
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
consequently double the power we now have. I will try this in the same
way we did the last time by leaving the vessel&rsquo;s stern on shore, and in the
meanwhile <i>I hope to hear your opinion of throwing wheels over the sides.
I will also be glad</i> to know if it is more agreeable to you to give a note for
the balance of your proportion of the expense attending this business or
whether you will make me a remittance in cash. Could I at present raise
money through the house of J. Mark for all the ends I have in this quarter
I would not solicit more money until you come down.  This however it

<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Clermont</span>, <i>18th Sept., 1798</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Mr. Mouchette is just returned. I sincerely congratulate you upon the
success of the engine of which he gives the most favourable report &amp; fully
justifies yr. confidence in your engines. I am sufficiently sanguine to hope
that all difficulties are now vanished. Knowing our power nothing remains
but adapt the vessel to it. In attempting this hitherto we have deceived
ourselves by wandering into the field of conjecture rather than adhereing
to plain calculations &amp; we shall still do so if we expect that the present
engine will turn the wheels we now have 80 times in a minute, as will appear
from this calculation. Our wells contain exactly 60 cubic feet of
water. The whole of this is set in motion at every revolution of the wheels
with a rapidity equal to the main motion of the arms, that is if the wheels
make 80 revolutions in a minute at the rate of 8 miles an hour. Now as
the boat will not remove more than 20 feet of water if she goes 8 miles an
hour, if it was possible to move the wheels as they are now constructed 80
rounds in a minute we should throw away one half of our power, for the
boat could not move faster than the water in the wheels &amp; the power
would be uselessly expended in throwing out water unnecessarily.</p>
<p>But it will be found on experiment that however perfect our engine is, it
cannot turn the present wheels 80 times in a minute. The wheels then
must necessarily be altered or the motion rendered still slower. To make
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
the motion slower is to diminish our chance of moving the boat fast because
she will at no rate move faster than the water in the wheels though she
may be made to move as fast as I have found on actual experiment. The
wheels then must be altered, not by making the arms shorter for this would
diminish their motion, besides that it would require an alteration in the
boat&mdash;but by diminishing their depth. They are now if I recollect 18
Inches deep, let them be reduced to nine Inches.</p>
<p>Let the motion of the wheels by no means exceed 80 nor be lower than
70 turns in a minute and I will answer for the success of the experiment,
&amp; upon the whole it will turn out a fortunate discovery since we shall find
that our wells need not be above half the size we have made them &amp; of
course much room and much weight of water be saved in future. That we
have erred hitherto should not discourage us. It is the fate of all new
undertakings and it is happy when the error can be so easily discovered &amp;
detected. Another circumstance of considerable moment must be attended
to. If the diminution of the motion is brought about by changing the sun
and planet wheels, one half the motion of the flys will be lost &amp; they rendered
almost useless from this circumstance. If they are made heavier
they will overload the boat.</p>
<p>I would propose as the best mode of altering the motion of the wheels
to alter the cog wheels &amp; to leave the sun and planet wheels as they were&mdash;this
will give the proper motion to the fly &amp; diminish the friction. Let
the cog wheels be made smaller and have no more cogs than the trunnel
rounds, or only so many more as will serve to give the motion we require.
Nor will this alteration be attended with more trouble than the one at first
proposed; but even if it is, it is so essential to give the flys a rapid motion
that we must, now we have gone so far, submit to this trouble and expense
to have this experiment properly made. <i>I say nothing on the subject of</i>
<span class="smaller">WHEELS OVER THE SIDES</span> <i>as I am perfectly convinced from a variety of experiments
of the superiority of those we have adopted</i>. I expect to be down
the last of this month when I shall see you &amp; make such money arrangements
as we may find necessary.</p>
<p>In the meantime I hope to hear how you go on. I flatter myself no delay
will be incurred which can possibly be avoided, every moment being precious.
Mr. Mark will I hope forward this to you the moment it arrives, so
that the necessary alterations may be made before you proceed far on any
difficult plan.</p>
<p>I am very much hurt that you should construe any part of my former
letters into a reflection on your candour. I am sure that nothing of this
kind was ever intended &amp; I flatter myself that if you attend a little more
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
to the expressions (tho: I cannot now recollect them) that they will not
bear this harsh construction.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I dropped you a line in haste on Friday last, since which I received your
favour of the 10th: the person to whom you gave it in charge did not put
it in the post office until yesterday. Your instructions therefore came too
late for the rims, as they had by your former request been left off and no
bad consequence has resulted. I have not yet seen Mr. Stevens, but have
been expecting him every day, as he requested me by letter to inform him
what time we would be ready, which I did. Had I received your letter
sooner I would also have sent to see if Mr. Mouchet was still at N. Ark
&amp; requested him to come up.</p>
<p>There was no occasion to try the wheels from 5 Inches upwards, as I
found the Engine overloaded at 5. I think at present the most advisable
mode of proceeding for us will be to change the wheels on shaft and spindle
so as to give the Engine her full speed with 50 revolutions of the lower
wheels, and if she will carry more, then increase the width of the paddles.
I have ordered a pattern made for two wheels accordingly and will cast
them the first casting we make after it is finished. Please to write me if
you agree in this respect. The Spanish Minister was on board the day we
made the last experiment and was perfectly well pleased with the operation
of the Engine and will give us an order for one of 36 Inches. This will cost
him upwards of 13,000 Dolls: Our small one is not equal to the purposes
for which he wants his. During our sail he, at the time the tide and wind
favoured us, supposed we went at the rate of 6 miles an hour; but I think
the delight he felt expressed at the novelty of the Voyage was the cause of
his mistake. My report to you was three miles, still water, which I have
reason to believe was accurate. I have at present a better opinion of your
plan than ever, and could wish them to be contrasted with paddles upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Mr. Stevens&rsquo; plan, <span class="smaller">OR WHEELS OVER THE SIDES</span>, so as fairly to ascertain
the difference of the application of the power. We have by the last experiment
a striking proof in favor of your plan which is demonstrated by the
diminution in width and slow motion of the wheels. At our last experiment
the effect was certainly greater than we could have promised ourselves.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon, and in the meanwhile will do what strikes
me as reasonable upon our present plan so that no time is lost.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mark requests me to thank you for your polite invitation of visiting
Mrs. Livingston, but does not think it will be in her power this fall,
as Mr. Mark is at present too much occupied with business to leave home.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Clermont</span>, <i>28 Octr., 1798</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>After sending mine of yesterday I received your favor of the 21st, in
which you enter more particularly into the experiments you have made,
but not so fully as I would wish, as you will find by the queries I have
troubled you with. If you are right as to the motion through the water,
the Spanish Minister could not err much in his calculation, for it appears
to me that the tide in your river is not short of 2 miles &amp; I have found in
my models that the velocity of the boat with the tide is greater in proportion
than the mere difference between that and still water.</p>
<p>This is one of the experiments I wished you to ascertain accurately by
running one hour with the tide &amp; determining the distance and running
back the same distance against the tide. Be it as it will, we now know
what we can do with a sufficient power, and tho&rsquo; <i>paddles should even do
more they are too inconvenient and too liable to accidents to be used</i>&mdash;<span class="smaller">AS FOR
VERTICAL WHEELS THEY ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION</span>.</p>
<p>What I principally write now for is to ask you whether it would not be
better instantly to fit the boat for passengers by putting a deck over so
much as you make cabbin of. This should be the whole, only leaving
room for wood near the engine. This deck should be of inch pine boards
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
&amp; rounded so as to carry off the water and made as tight as possible. It
should be raised about ten Inches so as to admit of glasses that shove past
each other all round The inside only wants to be papered with any cheap
common paper and to have two rows of benches the one behind the other.
The rear bench so low as to admit the knees under the front one. A
narrow table of one board should run through the middle. The back
cabbin should be fitted for the ship&rsquo;s company and have windows and
shutters in case of bad weather. Some arrangement should also be made
for boiling in pot and kettle. All this should be going on while you are
fitting the machinery. It will I believe be best to get two or three quick
hands from New York to do it as your shipwright is both slow and extravagant.
We have yet one month to use and a pretty important one,
because the roads will soon be bad, and tho&rsquo; we should only go 3 miles an
hour we shall still be able to pick up something besides our expenses and
acquire some experience of what further is necessary. I have provided a
Captain at &pound;5 a month who understands the river. You say you have a
steward and fire engine hand. Tho&rsquo; I think Smallman should make the
first voyage.</p>

on the axis of which I put flyes, dispence with them or otherwise combine
them at pleasure, either to regulate motion or give additional velocity, or
they may be connected with the water shaft and steam Engine, by wheels
so as to give any number of revolutions that may be desired. The arms
of the water wheels I would make of wood, to which I attach floats or paddles
of cast Iron, or of Boiler plate thick sheet Iron, though they may be
made of wood. These floats I make move up and down on the arms, by
means of screws and holes, so as to make them enter deeper or shallower
in the water, in taking a purchase or hold on the water agreeably to the
depth of water the boat may draw, and the lading there may be on board,
or agreeably to other circumstances. The supporters of the outer ends of
the water wheels shaft to be made of Iron with braces, though if required

<p>Of the foregoing correspondence, but a small portion relates to the question
of wheels over the sides. It is inserted at length however,&mdash;going, as
it does, to shew the warm interest, and the active measures that were on
foot at the close of the eighteenth century to develope one of the mighty
agencies of the nineteenth. The crudeness of many of the suggestions and
the literary carelessness of the correspondence on both sides, is indicative of
a very different condition of things from that which exists at present.</p>

<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>Somewhere
about the year 1842, the writer of the foregoing address was
narrating the substance of it at the White Sulphur Springs of Virginia.
Among his hearers was Mr. Samuel Davis, of Philadelphia, but formerly
of Natchez, Mississippi, who supplemented the story with the following
anecdote. He was standing on the wharf at Natchez, one of a crowd,
watching the approach of the New Orleans on her first voyage. There
was a rise in the river at the time; and when the steamboat rounded to, to
head up stream, she was some short distance below the landing,&mdash;and, for
a while, the current was more than she could overcome. At Mr. Davis&rsquo;
side, was an old negro servant, who watched the struggle with much excitement,
slapping his thighs and gesticulating in a most outlandish way.
When at last, after a more rapid revolution of the wheels started the boat
ahead, the negro threw up his hat, exclaiming, &ldquo;By golly, Sa, old Massesseppa
got her massa; hooraw.&rdquo; Mr. Davis sent a quantity of his cotton
by the boat to New Orleans, against the advice of all his friends. He was
the first person who ventured a bale on such a risk!
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>The
reference here is to a letter of the Chancellor (numbered 25 in the collection
I have,) in which, being then in a dissatisfied and complaining mood, he says: &ldquo;I
again repeat, Sir, that I trust in a few days to hear that experiments have been made
and to be minutely acquainted with the result, that I may take my measures accordingly.
In doing of which should wish to receive your advice. From a frank and candid
communication much more advantage will result to all parties than from reserve,
silence and distrust.</div>
